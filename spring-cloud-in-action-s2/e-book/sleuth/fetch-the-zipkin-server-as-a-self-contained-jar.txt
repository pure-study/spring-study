The quickest way to get started is to fetch the latest released server as a self-contained executable jar. Note that the Zipkin server requires minimum JRE 8. For example:

$ curl -sSL https://zipkin.io/quickstart.sh | bash -s
$ java -jar zipkin.jar

Once you've started, browse to http://your_host:9411 to find traces!

----------
Strat the server with RabbitMQ
$ RABBIT_ADDRESSES=localhost java -jar zipkin-server-2.19.1-exec.jar
